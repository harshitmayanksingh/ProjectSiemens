# Object Recognition, Classification, and Detection Project 

This project focuses on object recognition, classification, and detection. It is an educational endeavor aimed at understanding how these processes work, starting from simple neural networks and potentially advancing to larger pre-trained models. 

Our main performance metric is not the ultimate performance of the model, but the optimization of learning throughout the process. As such, the loss function is used to assess and refine our learning approach, rather than the model's performance.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to install the required packages. Assuming you're using pip, you can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
