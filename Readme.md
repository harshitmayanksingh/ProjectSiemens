# Surface Defect Detection using Deep Learning

Detecting and categorizing these defects accurately is crucial for maintaining product quality and ensuring safety in various industries, including construction, automotive, and manufacturing. 


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Matplotlib

### Model
`
The model architecture used for this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It has been trained to classify surface defects in hot-rolled steel strips into six categories. For details about the model architecture, training, and performance, refer to the model_1.h5 file.

### IMPLEMENTATION

Step1-> Download the trained model file from the link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cypaKw6dtgOlizMLopvWr3wGtlVZKmu_/view?usp=sharing

Step2-> Install the Pre-Requisite Libraries

Step3-> Open the app.py file on VisualStudioCode

Step4-> Load the model using Keras.load

Step5-> Change the Path for the image you want to test upon.

Step6-> Run code

#The model training code is saved as Training.py and need not be used for testing as the best iteration of model is already saved as model1.h5
